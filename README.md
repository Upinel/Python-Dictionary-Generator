# Python Dictionary Generator

Python Dictionary Generator is a simple script that generates all possible combinations of characters for a given range of lengths and character types. This script can be particularly useful in creating wordlists for testing and educational purposes, such as brute force attacks in ethical hacking exercises.

## Features

* Generate combinations of different character classes, including numeric, uppercase, lowercase, and alphanumeric characters.
* Define the minimum and maximum size for generated words.
* Output the combinations directly into a file for easy use and distribution.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x

## Installation

## Usage

To use the Python Dictionary Generator, navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the script and run the main script:
```bash
cd Python-Dictionary-Generator
python generator.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to configure the generator settings, such as filename, character class choices, min size, and max size of the words.
```bash
Example usage:

Please enter the file name: output.txt
1) Numbers
2) Capital Letters
3) Lowercase Letters
4) Numbers + Capital Letters
5) Numbers + Lowercase Letters
6) Numbers + Capital Letters + Lowercase Letters
7) Capital Letters + Lowercase Letters
Please select the character class by number: 6
What is the min size of the word? 4
What is the max size of the word? 6
```
This will generate all possible alphanumeric combinations of lengths ranging from 4 to 6 characters and save them in the file output.txt.
